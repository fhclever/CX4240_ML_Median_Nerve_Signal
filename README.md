# CX4240_ML_Median_Nerve_Signal

All code for CX4240 group project. We worked on multiple linear regression, softmax sigmoid neural network, and k means.

We examine elctrode data from Biocircuit Technologies. This electrode data is recorded down the forearm over the median nerve, which is a common source of peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs). Biocircuit is attempting to improve the practice of nerve conduction studies (NCS) using their electrode patch and wanted us to see if we could discern some signals from the middle of the arm using machine learning. At the middle of the arm, the median nerve goes very deep into the skin and so it is more difficult for clinicians to localize PNIs in this regions and determine their severity.
